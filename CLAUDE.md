# Flexx - Pure JavaScript Flexbox Layout Engine

Yoga-compatible API, 1.5-2.5x faster initial layout, 5.5x faster no-change re-layout, 2.5-3.5x smaller, pure JavaScript (no WASM).

## Commands

```bash
bun test              # Run all tests
bun bench             # Run performance benchmarks
bun run typecheck     # Type check
```

## Performance is Critical

Flexx's value proposition is **performance**. Any change that MAY impact performance requires benchmark verification:

```bash
# Check for CPU-heavy processes that would skew results
top -l 1 -n 5 -stats command,cpu | head -10

# BEFORE making changes
bun bench bench/yoga-compare-warmup.bench.ts > /tmp/bench-before.txt

# Make your changes...

# Check CPU load again (should match pre-change conditions)
top -l 1 -n 5 -stats command,cpu | head -10

# AFTER making changes
bun bench bench/yoga-compare-warmup.bench.ts > /tmp/bench-after.txt

# Compare results - look for regressions
diff /tmp/bench-before.txt /tmp/bench-after.txt
```

**Before each benchmark run**, verify no CPU-heavy processes (builds, other test suites, browsers, video encoding) are running. Inconsistent system load invalidates comparisons.

**Changes that require benchmarking:**

- Any modification to `src/layout-zero.ts` (the core algorithm)
- Any modification to `src/node-zero.ts` (Node class)
- Adding new features that affect layout calculation
- Refactoring hot paths

**Acceptable performance impact:**

- Regressions < 5% for minor features
- No regressions for refactoring (must be neutral or faster)
- Document any trade-offs in PR description

## Architecture

- **Zero-allocation design** in layout-zero.ts - reuses FlexInfo objects
- **Yoga API compatibility** - same constants, same method names
- **Two algorithms**: zero (production) and classic (debugging)

## Intentional Divergences from Yoga

Flexx is Yoga-compatible but follows CSS spec where Yoga doesn't:

| Behavior                                  | Yoga                                                     | Flexx                      | CSS Spec                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `overflow:hidden/scroll` + `flexShrink:0` | Item expands to content size (ignores parent constraint) | Item shrinks to fit parent | §4.5: automatic min-size = 0 for overflow containers |

**Details**: Yoga defaults `flexShrink` to 0 (unlike CSS's default of 1) and doesn't implement CSS §4.5's rule that overflow containers have `min-size: auto = 0`. This means in Yoga, an `overflow:hidden` child with 30 lines of content inside a height-10 parent will compute as height 30 — defeating the purpose of overflow clipping. Flexx ensures overflow containers can always shrink (`flexShrink >= 1`), matching CSS browser behavior. See `tests/yoga-overflow-compare.test.ts` for comparison tests.

## Testing

```bash
bun test                                              # All tests (1368)
bun test tests/yoga-comparison.test.ts tests/yoga-overflow-compare.test.ts  # Yoga compatibility (41)
bun test tests/layout.test.ts                         # Layout algorithm tests
bun test tests/relayout-consistency.test.ts  # Re-layout fuzz (1200+)
```

### Re-layout Consistency Tests

The most important test layer. 1200+ fuzz tests verify that incremental re-layout of partially-dirty trees matches fresh layout. Uses a differential oracle: build tree → layout → dirty → re-layout → compare against fresh. Has caught 3 distinct caching bugs invisible to single-pass tests.

**When fixing layout bugs**: Run `bun test tests/relayout-consistency.test.ts` — if it passes, the fix is likely correct. If a specific seed fails, use `-t "seed=N"` to isolate.

**Mutation testing**: `bun scripts/mutation-test.ts` verifies the fuzz suite catches 4 deliberate cache mutations (4 others are equivalent/defense-in-depth). Run after modifying cache logic.

**When modifying caching/fingerprint code**: Run the full suite. Any new failures indicate a correctness regression.

See `docs/testing.md` for test methodology, `docs/incremental-layout-bugs.md` for bug taxonomy and industry context.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't allocate in hot paths** - layout-zero.ts avoids `new` in layout loops
- **Don't add WASM** - pure JS is the point
- **Don't break Yoga API** - compatibility is a feature
